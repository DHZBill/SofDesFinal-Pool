####Reflection and Synthesis

##Feedback and Decisions

From our technical review, we received a lot of helpful feedback regarding our current implementation of image detection.  We learned about a lot of different functions from cv2 that we could use, including a recommendation to use circle recognition rather than the contour function that we had previously included in our implementation. Our presentation was brief yet still beneficial.

##Review Process Reflection

Our presentation was designed to allow audience members to give holistic feedback on any aspects of the project that we discussed.  We feel that our presentation was concise and we presented our content effectively.  The audience had enough information on the current state of our project as well as our goals to offer critical feedback. We used our time efficiently and got more feedback than we expected, which helped us decide on future plans while sticking to our presentationâ€™s agenda.
