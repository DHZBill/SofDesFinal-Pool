##Pool Assistant
By:Bill Du, Jeremy Garcia, John Moreland, Andrew Pan

#Background and context
Our goal is to create an interactive and intelligent billiards assistant. It will be a visual aid for planning the trajectories of the balls. Using a projector and camera, we hope our aid will be able to project the trajectory of the cue ball and all other balls that are affected by the cue ball. 

In the review, we hope to validate our system architecture with analysis from outside parties and gain insight on the implementation of of our GUI.  We also hope to learn from the planning methods other teams are utilizing in structuring their projects.  We are currently contemplating how we will read in the images to process with our program, as we have to find a way to place the camera directly above the pool table.  Our current idea is to create a PVC structure to hold the camera.  An outside perspective would be particularly useful in brainstorming ideas for reading in images, and for suggesting ways we could display the information from our program to users.

#Agenda for technical review session
-We will use whiteboards to get ideas from our classmates. /n
-We will go over our proposed system architecture and ask for feedback on general structure and compartmentalization.
