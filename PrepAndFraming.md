##Pool Assistant
By: Bill Du, Jeremy Garcia, John Moreland, Andrew Pan

#Background and context
Our goal is to create an interactive and intelligent billiards assistant. It will be a visual aid for planning the trajectories of the balls. Using a projector and camera, we hope our aid will be able to project the trajectory of the cue ball and all other balls that are affected by the cue ball. 

In this technical review, we hope to gain feedback on our current implementation of the billiards simulation and the way information is displayed to users.  We are currently working on reading in aerial images of pool tables and would like to gain insight on how in depth our program should be for differentiating between pool balls (differentiate based on color, numbers, etc.).  ##Words that need to be written

#Agenda for technical review session
-We will use whiteboards to get ideas from our classmates.

-We will go over our proposed system architecture and ask for feedback on general structure and compartmentalization.
