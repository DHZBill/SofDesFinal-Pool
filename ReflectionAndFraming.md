####Reflection and Framing

##Feedback and Decisions
The feedback we received regarding our questions of how to display information to users and how to read in information on the pool table helped us decide on how to progress with our project.  

We decided that live feedback is a major key to the project’s success. For displaying relevant information, we will try to find a projector to show how balls will move given a position for the cue, most likely borrowing one from IT.  If finding a projector proves to be infeasible, we draw a pool table with ball locations and predicted movements on a GUI that users can view on a computer screen, or with their phones if we create an app. We decided that a combination of visual and auditory signals would be ideal in this scenario. 

For capturing images of the pool table, we will attempt to use a webcam that will be hoisted above the pool table at a slight angle that will be corrected for in our calculations. Our main concern with this approach was that some balls may be obscured from the camera’s line of sight. However, we tested these positions after our review and decided that it shouldn't be a problem. 

##Review Process Reflection
Overall, we purposefully designed our review session to be fairly open ended and unstructured. We felt that we gave enough scaffolding for our audience to understand our goals without being overwhelmed with information. This allowed us to have plenty of time to discuss our questions with our peers.  For the most part, we stuck to our planned agenda for the review session and gained some insights from the back and forth discussion with other teams, taking a look at videos of similar projects that lended us some inspiration. For our next technical review, we hope to have more concrete progress on our project and possibly do some user testing.
